Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project implements a deep learning approach to predict customer churn using a Kaggle dataset. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization.
The first ANN model showed signs of overfitting, so a second model was trained with L2 regularization to improve generalization.

Workflow

1. Data Loading & Exploration – Import and inspect the dataset, identify key features and class imbalance.

2. Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize numerical features.

3. Model Architecture – Build and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras.

4. Training & Validation – Monitor loss and accuracy, apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
